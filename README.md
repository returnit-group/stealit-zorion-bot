# Who are we?
Just a group of security analysts who have fun poking at stealer groups :)

# What is this?
This is the leaked source for Stealit's stealer, bots, and C2 API. Some functionality is removed to prevent against rebuilding of this malware - if you belong to a security platform or organization, you can email us at returnit.group@proton.me for the raw source code.  

If you take a good look at the API, you'll probably figure out how we managed to do this :) 

# Why open-source it?

For educational purposes, because profiting from malware is dumb, and if people are dumb enough to build from this repo, it'll be picked up by detection engines pretty quickly

# DISCLAIMER

The source in this repo is only shared with the intention of use for educational purposes. The source has been defanged, and we do not support modification of the source to create malware, or the use of this source for illegal or unethical purposes.
